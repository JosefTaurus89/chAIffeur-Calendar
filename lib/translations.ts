        <ul>
            <li><strong>Month View:</strong> Best for high-level planning. Shows a concise list of jobs for each day.
                <ul>
                    <li><em>Click a Day:</em> Opens the Day view for that specific date.</li>
                    <li><em>Click a Service:</em> Selects that service for editing or detailed viewing.</li>
                    <li><em>Drag & Drop:</em> Quickly move a service from one day to another.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Week View:</strong> Visualize your workload hour-by-hour across 7 days.
                <ul>
                    <li>Great for spotting gaps in availability.</li>
                    <li>Drag services vertically to change times, or horizontally to change days.</li>
                </ul>

            <li><strong>Day View:</strong> The most detailed view. Manage precise timing and overlaps.

                    <li>Supports "side-by-side" scheduling for simultaneous jobs.</li>

            <li><strong>Delete:</strong> Moves the service to the Trash (recoverable for 30 days).</li>

            <li><strong>Driver Settlement:</strong> For internal drivers. It tracks <em>Cash Collected</em> vs <em>Expenses</em>. If a driver collects cash from a client, the system flags it as "Driver deposits to office".</li>
            <li><strong>Supplier Settlement:</strong> For outsourced jobs. It tracks <em>Cost</em> (what you pay them) vs <em>Cash Held</em> (what they collected from your client). The "Net Settlement" tells you who pays whom.</li>
            <li><strong>Agency Reports:</strong> For bookings from B2B partners (e.g., Booking.com, Viator). Tracks total revenue and commissions.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Reports & Invoices</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Monthly Overview:</strong> High-level view of Revenue, Cost, and Profit.</li>
            <li><strong>Invoices:</strong> A dedicated list for services marked as "Future Invoice". Use this to track accounts receivable (what agencies owe you) and accounts payable (what you owe suppliers).</li>
