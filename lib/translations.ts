            Welcome to <strong>New ChAIffeur Calendar</strong>, the intelligent management system designed for limousine services, transfer companies, and tour operators. 
            Unlike traditional spreadsheets or basic calendars, this app combines <strong>Google Calendar synchronization</strong> with <strong>AI automation</strong> to streamline your dispatching workflow.
